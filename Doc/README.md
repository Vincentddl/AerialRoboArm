# Documentation Index

This directory contains the curated documentation for the AerialRoboArm electrical-control subsystem. The repository does not include the undergraduate thesis document itself; these files provide the engineering context, contribution boundary, runtime architecture, hardware notes, demo notes, and historical archive.

## Primary Documents

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [MY_WORK.md](./MY_WORK.md) | Personal contribution boundary and work summary. |
| [About AI Assist Pipeline - Share.md](./About%20AI%20Assist%20Pipeline%20-%20Share.md) | DACMAS AI-native development workflow and methodology. |
| [design/00_SYSTEM_CONSTITUTION.md](./design/00_SYSTEM_CONSTITUTION.md) | Top-level project identity, system boundary, and design principles. |
| [design/01_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md](./design/01_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Runtime architecture, frequency domains, task organization, and data flow. |
| [hardware/pinmap.md](./hardware/pinmap.md) | STM32 pin assignment and external wiring reference. |
| [hardware/cubemx-demo-v7-checklist.md](./hardware/cubemx-demo-v7-checklist.md) | CubeMX step-by-step checklist for `demo_v7` real ST3215 bring-up day. |
| [demo/final-demo.md](./demo/final-demo.md) | Final `demo_v6` demo/testbench scope and media entry points. |

## Archive Policy

`archive/` keeps development-history materials that are useful for traceability but should not be treated as the current project entrance. This includes meeting notes, branch retrospectives, early protocol drafts, legacy figures, and the duplicated `Doc/Drivers` mirror that previously lived directly under `Doc/`.
